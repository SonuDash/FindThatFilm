Your braincells are firing every nook and corner of your memory cortex just to get the name, you close your eyes with force to focus and remember but the incomplete information from your brain is not enough you are not abe to connect dots, inside of your brain there's a war going on. You are anxious, "no way this can happen!". At this time the voice from the person sittng next to you reaches you ears, "great evening with you, I've to catch next train to Panwel, I'll get late."

You have f***ed up the date.

## Problem Statement
The intro to the application pretty much explains the problem statement. It's basically the problem that, cinema industry is ever-expanding, especially in an era where Indian-Film-Industry alone churns out 100s of movies every year, it's very hard to keep a track of all the name by the viewers, however some movies and their plots stand out to the viewers and this application will provide a medium to find the movies that viewers like using just keywords.
